# 🪄 CharAlchemy

CharAlchemy is a sleek **tokenizer and detokenizer** web tool that transforms any mix of **letters**, **numbers**, and **special characters** into their precise **ASCII values** — and back again.  
It also provides a **real-time mapping view** between characters and their tokenized values, making it a perfect learning aid for **developers, students, and curious minds**.

## 📅 Average Time to Complete
** 3–4 hours**  
(From idea to final polished version, including UI design and animations.)

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- How to **tokenize** and **detokenize** data using ASCII values in JavaScript.
- Building an **interactive UI** with **React + Tailwind CSS v4.1**.
- Designing **modern UI themes** with a minimal black `#000000` and accent orange `#F99727` color palette.
- Implementing **smooth background animations** using mouse tracking and delayed movement.
- Separating logic into **independent React components** for better scalability.

## 🛠️ Tech Used
- **React** – UI library for building components.
- **Tailwind CSS v4.1** – Utility-first styling with custom colors.
- **Vite** – Fast build tool and dev server.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Core logic for tokenization/detokenization.
- **CSS Blur & Transitions** – For smooth background animations.
- **Custom Mouse Tracker Component** – For animated glowing background following the cursor.

## 💡 How It Works
1. **Tokenization**:  
   - Enter a string into the **Tokenization Input**.  
   - Each character is converted into its **ASCII code**.
2. **Detokenization**:  
   - Enter ASCII values (comma-separated) into the **Detokenization Input**.  
   - Values are converted back into their original characters.
3. **Mapping View**:  
   - Shows **character → token** mapping in real-time for better understanding.

## 🎨 UI Theme
- **Primary Color:** `#000000` (Black)
- **Accent Color:** `#F99727` (Orange)
- **Effect:** Soft glow and blur backgrounds following the cursor.
